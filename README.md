#Crime Rate Prevention

#About the Project 
This project analyzes crime data to find trends and predict future crime rates. The goal is to help in crime prevention using data insights.

#Tools Used:-
- Python: Programming language  
- Pandas: For working with data  
- NumPy: For calculations  
- Matplotlib: For creating charts  
- FBProphet: For forecasting future trends  
- Linear Regression: For predicting crime rates  

#How to Use  

# Step 1: Download the Project

# Step 2: Install Required Tools  
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.  
2. Install the required tools by running:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
### Step 3: Prepare the Data  
- Use a dataset in CSV format (e.g., `Date`, `Crime_Type`, `Count`).  
- Save the file in the project folder.  

# Step 4: Run the Code  
- Open the project files in your Python editor (like Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, or PyCharm).  
- Follow the code to:  
  1. Analyze crime trends using Pandas and Matplotlib.  
  2. Predict crime rates with Linear Regression.  
  3. Forecast future trends with FBProphet.  
# What You Will See  
- Charts: Line graphs, bar charts showing crime trends.  
- Predictions: Forecasted crime rates for future months or years.
